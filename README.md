HTM Learning Algorithm Implementation for learning and regenerating musical Sequences

This Project is trying to create a implementation of the HMT learning Algorithm (see www.numenta.org), which is able to recognise and model common, reoccuring pattern or structures in a given set of musical data. 
This sould then be used to 'rewrite' compareable musical sequences by combining the learned patterns in a new way. This way one could have all his/her favorite music (with similiar attributes) learned and modeled by the HTM and have it regenerate music that recombines ones favorites.
